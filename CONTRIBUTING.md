## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interesting in contributing! Since the project is yet quite in its infancy, there aren't many guidelines to follow.


### Setup and Documentation
- Please make sure you have gone through the project documentation in `README`  
- If you find something unclear or undocumented, please raise an issue    
- Try to setup the dev environment and get the server running locally. Please raise an issue if you come across any


### Contributing

#### Fixing a bug
- If you find a bug, please submit an issue explaining it with reproduction steps
- If you wish to address the bug, open an issue nevertheless and mention that you are working on it
- Create a Pull Request and wait for review  and address any concerns raised as soon as you can
- We will try to review and respond as soon as possible  

#### Adding a feature
- Same steps apply as fixing a bug, but most importantly make sure you create an issue describing the feature  
- Go ahead, develop the feature and raise a PR

With your help, we will keep revising and improving the README and CONTRIBUTING documents
